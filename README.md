## Introduction

This is version 2 of MunkiWebAdmin, a web-based administration tool for Munki.

All reporting (formerly part of MunkiWebAdmin) has been removed from MunkiWebAdmin2 â€” consider using Sal or MunkiReport-PHP for reporting. Both are excellent.

MunkiWebAdmin2 focuses on web-based editing of manifests and pkginfo files.

This is in-development code. Use it with a production Munki repo with care -- make sure you have functioning backups!

## Getting started

### On OS X (10.7+):

*   You'll need `git` installed; either via Xcode, the command-line developer tools, or a standalone install of `git`.

*   Download and expand this zip:    
    https://github.com/munki/contrib/raw/master/mwa2_demo.zip

*   Via the command-line, run the script within the expanded zip:
    `/Users/me/Downloads/mwa2_demo/run_mwa2.sh`

*   Follow the script prompts. Of note, at one place you'll be advised to edit a settings file. Specifically, you'll edit `mwa2/munkiwebadmin/settings.py`. Near the end of this file is this:

```python
# MUNKI_REPO_DIR holds the local filesystem path to the Munki repo
MUNKI_REPO_DIR = '/Users/Shared/munki_repo'
```

*   Edit `MUNKI_REPO_DIR` to point to a Munki repo to use with MWA2. This repo should be writable by the user running MWA2. Please do initial testing on a non-production repo. Since MWA2 can make changes to your repo, if you do decide to use it with a production repo -- make sure you have functioning backups!


*   After editing `settings.py`, run `run_mwa2.sh` again to continue the setup process.

*   Once all the setup tasks are complete, a development server will be launched, and MWA2 should be available at http://localhost:8080

#### run_mwa2.sh script details

*   git clones `https://github.com/munki/mwa2.git` from GitHub into the script directory. (if needed)
*   Copies `settings_template.py` to `settings.py` and asks you to edit it. (if needed)
*   Creates the needed sqlite3 database. (if needed)
*   Prompts you to create the initial superuser. (if needed)
*   Uses the included CherryPy dev server to serve MWA2.

### Linux

See https://github.com/munki/mwa2/wiki/RHEL7-setup-notes for some notes on installing and configuring MWA2 on RedHat Enterprise Linux 7.
